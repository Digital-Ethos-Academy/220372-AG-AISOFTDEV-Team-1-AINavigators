        "- **Employee Management**: Role, LCAT, Name, Funded Hours tracking\n",
        "- **Hours Allocation**: Monthly allocation with automatic FTE percentage calculation\n",
        "- **Full-Time Hours**: Auto-calculated per month based on business days (editable)\n",
        "- **Sprint-Based Timelines**: 2-week sprints with automatic week/month calculations\n",
        "- **Validation**: Funded hours limits, monthly capacity checks, FTE threshold validation\n",
        "- **Roll-up Views**: Multi-project dashboards with cross-project visibility\n",
        "- **AI Agents**: Auto FTE calculation, conflict detection, optimization recommendations\n",
        "- **RAG Interface**: Natural language queries for staffing data\n",

        "### Next Steps:\n",
        "- **Phase 2**: Use the PRD to generate system architecture and database schema\n",
        "- **Phase 3**: Build the FastAPI backend with Role/LCAT/FTE models\n",
        "- **Phase 4**: Create tests and perform security review\n",
